I tried to create something similar to a board game.

This is the second program that prompts the user for turtle color and background color.

Reflection:
  When I was creating my first turtle program, I had an idea of creating something similar to a gameboard. At times it was difficult to reproduce the ideas that I had in my head. For example, if I was to improve upon what I have now, I would want to have multiple turtles on my gameboard, similar to having multiple people playing a game. I am still unsure on how to do this. Another thing I included was a prompt asking how many spots should "Tina" move forward. I was wondering if there was a way to limit the amount of moving forward so that Tina doesn't go off the board. Overall, it was really neat to see something that I created with only a small amount of knowledge in python. This just proves that with more understanding, I can create something epic. The second program was interesting to create. It basically calls upon a variable which has the user input. I think user interaction is a very important part of creating something intriguing because it allows for uniqueness. Overall, both programs were great intros to python and building blocks to creating more complex programs.
